Under The Wire is the PowerShell Training platform.
It is free for everyone to practice and can be access from https://underthewire.tech/
There is WARGAMES menu where all the games are listed. 

In these repositories, you can check all the answer and the different way to solving questions.
I recommend you have a go before you check the solutions.

Master your PowerShell skills :) Good Luck
